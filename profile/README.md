# Frel

Frel is a declarative DSL for building reactive, platform-independent user interfaces,
focused on intent rather than implementation details.

The **Frel Compiler** compiles Frel to multiple host languages (Rust, TypeScript, Kotlin).

The **Frel Runtime** manages reactivity and renders the UI to multiple platforms (web, 
native mobile, desktop, PDF).

Frel emphasizes a compact runtime footprint, deterministic rendering, and clean separation
between declarative UI definitions and platform-specific adapters.

Key features:

- Declarative, reactive UI components
- Programming language agnostic (host language independent)
- Platform agnostic (web, mobile, desktop, documents)
- Compact runtime with minimal overhead

Repositories:

## Project Status: Early Design Phase

Frel is currently in the **planning and early design** stage.

Expect:

- Rapidly changing concepts and structures
- Incomplete or exploratory code
- Discussions and design documents instead of working examples

If you’re interested in the long-term vision or want to follow the design process,
check out the [frel](https://github.com/frel-ui/frel) repository.

If you’re looking for a production-ready UI library — check back later!

## Current Focus

- Designing the architecture
- Writing parts which have somewhat finished designs

## Contributing

Early feedback on design direction, architecture, and API ideas is welcome through
GitHub discussions or issues. Once the design stabilizes, contribution guidelines will be added.

## AI Assist Policy

Let's assume that we are smart people, and we do think before we act. Also, let's
not assume that it will be viable to code without AI assistants in the future.

With those two assumptions in mind, feel free to generate whatever you want (I do),
but please, pretty please, **think** when you do so.

I use AI extensively to help me with the design process. I do read what they generate
and adjust it as I see fit. That said, my experience is that something always slips
through the cracks, sorry about that.

Eventually I will clean up the design documents and they will change less frequently.

For utils, I will freely use any AI assistants. These are small helper programs;
it’s acceptable if they’re not perfect (within reason).

Unit tests will almost always be generated by AI.

Library code will need very strict review. I guess this will evolve over time, for
now I try to **think** before adding anything written by AI.
